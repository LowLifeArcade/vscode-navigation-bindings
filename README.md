## arrow keys replacements

Effective navigation bindings for editor as well as menu navigation in widgets, quick open and file browser. You can still use arrow keys, but this handy inverted T under the right hand lets you fly through your files with U and O as word jumps. Taken from a [reddit form](https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/7lv8nx/comment/drp8b2k/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). And helped with bindings from this [reddit post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55158950/vs-code-remap-certain-arrow-key-functionality)
